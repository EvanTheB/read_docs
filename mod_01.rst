The circled numbers in the image correspond to the numbered items below that provide further details for each submission option.

1. Log in using your webin submission account credentials and go to the **New Submission** tab.
2. If you have not done so already, **register a study** using this option. Module 2_ describes this step in more detail.
3. If you have not done so already, **register samples** using this option. Module 3_ describes this step in more detail.
4. Use this option to **submit sequence reads and experiments**. You can register a study and samples as part of this workflow
but we recommended that you pre-register your study and samples. Note that you must first upload your sequence read data files
into your private Webin upload area (see `Data Uploads <upload_01.html>`_) before the files can be submitted here.
Module 4_ describes this step in more detail.
5. Use this option to **submit genome assemblies**. You can register a study and samples as part of this workflow
but we recommend that you pre-register your study and samples.  Note that you must first upload your genome assembly data files
into your private Webin upload area (see `Data Uploads <upload_01.html>`_) before the files can be submitted here.
Module 6_ describes this step in more detail.
7. Use this option to **submit other assembled and annotated sequences** for example coding genes and rRNA sequences.
More information about this step is available `here <https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/submit/sequence-submission>`_.
8. You must apply an organism or environmental taxonomic classification to submitted samples. Use this option to check
that your samples have a recognized taxonomic classification or to request new ones.
For more information about taxonomy there is a section in the FAQ_ that may be useful.
