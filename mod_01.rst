Module 1: Submission Options
****************************

Interactive Webin
=================

Submissions to ENA can be made using the `Interactive Webin <https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/submit/sra/#home>`_ submission service.

The Interactive Webin supports the following submission options:

The circled numbers in the image correspond to the numbered items below that provide further details for each submission option.

1. Log in using your webin submission account credentials and go to the **New Submission** tab.
2. Use the **Register study (project)** option to register new studies used to group submitted information together.
   Module 2_ describes this step in more detail.
3. Use the **Register samples** option to register new samples used to describe the sequenced source material.
   Module 3_ describes this step in more detail.
4. Use the **Submit sequence reads and experiments** option to submit sequence reads with associated experimental information.
   You can register a study and samples as part of this workflow but we recommended that you pre-register your study and samples.
   Note that you must first upload your sequence read data files into your private Webin upload area (see `Data Uploads <upload_01.html>`_)
   before the files can be submitted here. Module 4_ describes this step in more detail.
5. Use the **Submit genome assemblies** option to submit assembled genomes. You can register a study and samples as part of this workflow
   but we recommend that you pre-register your study and samples.  Note that you must first upload your genome assembly data files
   into your private Webin upload area (see `Data Uploads <upload_01.html>`_) before the files can be submitted here.
   Module 6_ describes this step in more detail.
7. Use the **Submit other assembled and annotated sequences** option to submit coding genes, rRNA sequences and other
   annotated sequences. More information about this step is available `here <https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/submit/sequence-submission>`_.
8. Use the **Taxonomy Check/Request ** option to check that your samples have recognized taxonomic classifications
   or to register new ones. You must provide a taxonomic classification for each submitted sample.
   For more information about taxonomy there is a section in the FAQ_ that may be useful.
