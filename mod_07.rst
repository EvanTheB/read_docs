Module 7: Genome Assembly Update and Resubmission
=================================================

You may need to update or resubmit a genome assembly for a number of reasons, such as:

- A mistake was made in the submission
- A file in the submission was found to contain errors
- You have new information to add to the assembly

The procedures described here can involve several manual steps on the part of ENA curators.
Therefore, if you are performing an update or resubmission, expect to be in contact with us and allow some time for the completion of this process.

==============================

In this case, there will have been some problem with your assembly.
You will have identified this for yourself, or the ENA will have contacted you about it.

When you are resubmitting, you should proceed as directed in the `Genome Assembly Submission <mod_06.html>`_ section, with the following considerations:
