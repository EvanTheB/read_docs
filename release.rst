Data Release Policies
=====================


How Is Data Publicity Managed?
------------------------------
Data publicity is controlled from the level of study objects.
When a study is made public, all samples, experiments, runs and analyses associated with it are also made public.


Can I Delay/Advance The Release Date?
-------------------------------------
You can edit the release date of a study from within your Webin account:
In the 'Studies' tab, find the study you wish to change and click the pencil icon adjacent to its current release date.
You can move the date to be sooner or later as required.

I Released My Study, Why Can't I Find It In The Public Database?
----------------------------------------------------------------
After a study is made public, it can take up to 48 hours for your data to be searchable in the public database.
Please take this into consideration if you have a strict deadline by which your data must be public.
If after 48 hours your data remain confidential, please contact datasubs@ebi.ac.uk


Can I Make My Study Partially Available?
----------------------------------------
Unfortunately, this is not a service we provide.
If you need evidence of your submission for reviewers, forward them the email confirming your successful submission, or ask them to contact us, CC-ing you.


I Need To Delete Or Suppress A Study - Can I?
---------------------------------------------
These are not operations you can perform yourself.
You should contact datasubs@ebi.ac.uk and provide an explanation of the issue, along with the accession(s) to be suppressed/deleted.
The action will be handled by an ENA curator.

If you are requesting a suppression, provide a new release date.
If you are requesting a deletion, please be very clear about exactly which objects and accessions in your study you wish to have deleted.
