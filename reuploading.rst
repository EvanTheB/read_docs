Module 9: Reuploading Genome Assembly Files
===========================================

There are different reasons to reupload new genome assembly submission files.

Scenario 1: You realised that the submitted files are incorrect
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If for any reason you may need to change the files of a submission already done, you must contact us before. We may need to cancel the original submission and you may need to resubmit. Please note that after a submission is done and you got an analysis accession number (ERZxxxxxx), you must not reupload new files because they will not be taken in account by the automatic pipeline.

Scenario 2: You are contacted by ENA and requested to reupload corrected files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In this case, the ENA genome assembly pipeline has failed because of errors at the file(s) level. Therefore, we request you to reupload new files. Please note, and this is very important, that you *do not need to resubmit* the assembly, you do not need to go through the same steps than when you made the original submission. You only need to reupload the corrected file to your Webin box.


How to Reupload the Files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Please find the instructions `here <upload_01.html>`_.


When you reupload files, the files must have *the same name* than in the original submission and must also be *gz compressed*. If one of these requirement are not satisfied, the automatic pipeline won't be able to recognise and process the new uploaded files.
