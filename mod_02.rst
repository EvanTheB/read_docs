Module 2: Register a Study
**************************

This form is used to register a study (also referred to as a project). Studies are typically registered before any data is submitted.
Data can be added to the study at any time.

Please see module 1_ how to access this form.

Webin will report an accession number for the study that starts with PRJEB. This accession number is called the BioProject accession
and is typically used in journal publications. The study will also be assigned an alternative accession number that starts with ERP.
This accession number is called the SRA (Sequence Read Archive) study accession.

The study and any associated data will not become public until the study release date has expired (*).
This means that the data linked to the study will not be visible until the study itself is visible.

Have a look at an `example <http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/PRJEB1234>`_ of a study in the ENA browser.
