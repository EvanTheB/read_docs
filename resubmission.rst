Module 7: Genome Assembly Resubmissions
=======================================

You may need to resubmit a genome assembly for different reasons. For example, you may have realised you made a mistake during a submission already done or you may have been requested by ENA to resubmit because the original submission was not correct. In any case, the original submission must be cancelled before the reubmission can be done so please always contact ENA before resubmitting if it was not requested by us.

To resubmit a genome assembly, you must proceed as in the `original submission <mod_06.html>`_ with the following considerations:

1) You must have the ENA confirmation that the original submission has been cancelled.
2) There is no need to register a new study, you can use the same study (PRJEBxxx).
3) There is no need to register a new sample, you can use the same sample (ERSxxxxxx).

Please proceed as described `here <mod_06.html>`_ in Part 1 to Part 5.
